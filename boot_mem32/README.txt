Top level directories:

src......source files
include..header files
etc......tool arguments files
report...synthesis report files
netlist..post synthesis netlists
sdf......post synthesis timing data
dc.......synthesis tool scripts
pt.......timing analysis tool scripts
cons.....design constraints


The following scripts are used to simulate, synthesize the
design:

./sim.csh.......RTL/Netlist Simulation Script
./syn.csh.......Logic Synthesize Script
./pt.csh........Timing Analysis Script
 
Obviously the gate level design will require substantially more time
to simulate than the RTL design.
