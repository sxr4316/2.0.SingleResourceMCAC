# Single Resource MultiChannel ADPCM Codec (Verilog)
Verilog Implementation of a 32 Channel ADPCM Encoder Decoder, which uses a AMBER Core to run a firmware and a dedicated Co-processor to perform fixed-point floating arithmetic to perform the Encoding the Pulse Code Modulated Data stream into Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulated data form, which requires lesser bandwidth compared to the original PCM coded data
