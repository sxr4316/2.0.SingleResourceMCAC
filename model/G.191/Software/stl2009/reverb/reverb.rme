==================================================================
History: 
The ITU-T Reverberation software tool was first released in 
STL2005 (Cyril Guillaume & Stephane Ragot, France Telecom, France)
In STL2009, the following updates have been performed:
 - inclusion of a mono impulse response for fullband audio signals 
 (Minjie Xie, Polycom, USA)
 - inclusion of stereo impulse responses for superwideband audio signals 
 (Claude Marro, David Virette, France Telecom, France)
 - proper saturation of the reverberated output signals 
 (Jonas Svedberg, Ericsson, Sweden)
================================================================


The ITU-T/UGST Reverberation module contains the following files:


General:
~~~~~~~~
 reverb.rme: ..... Read-me file for Reverberation module (this file)


C code: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 reverb.c: ....... demonstration program using routines in reverb-lib.c
 reverb-lib.c: ... tools for reverberation
 reverb-lib.h: ... Prototypes for reverb-lib.c

Room Impulse responses ('IR' folder) :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mono folder
~~~~~~~~~~~
IR responses in mono are stored in 2 folders : IR\mono\big_endian and IR\mono\little_endian.
Folder IR\mono\big_endian contains UNIX byte oriented files (high-byte first) 
and 
folder IR\mono\little_endian contains low-byte-first oriented files.
  - File visio.IR: sound capture at 100cm distance in a small video-conferencing room,
  - File meeting50.IR: sound capture at 50cm distance in a meeting room,
  - File meeting100.IR: sound capture at 100cm distance in the same meeting room.
  - File IR48.IR: sound sampling at 48kHz.
WARNING : The first three impulse responses were measured with a sampling frequency of 32kHz. 
They are for use with 32 kHz sampled speech files. The last impulse IR48.IR is sampled at 48kHz. 
It is for use with 48 kHz sampled speech files.

stereo folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IR responses in stereo are stored in 2 folders : IR\stereo\big_endian and IR\stereo\little_endian.
Folder IR\stereo\big_endian contains UNIX byte oriented files (high-byte first)
and folder IR\stereo\little_endian contains low-byte-first oriented files.
WARNING : All these impulse responses were measured with a sampling frequency of 32kHz. 
They are for use with 32 kHz sampled speech files.
				
Makefiles
~~~~~~~~~
Makefiles have been provided for automatic build-up of the executable program
and to process the test sequences, WHEN made available by the user and left
in the subdirectory "bin":
makefile.cl : .... makefile for MS Visual C compiler
makefile.unx: .... makefile for cygwin gcc compiler

The MS Visual C provided makefile can run a portability test on the demo program. They 
need the archive test-freqresp.zip ([pk]zip compatible archive) and [pk]unzip to 
extract the proper source and reference processed files. This file can be found in ..\freqresp\

test-rev.zip: ...... ZIP-compatible archive with the test files in the UNIX 
			   byte orientation (high-byte first).
