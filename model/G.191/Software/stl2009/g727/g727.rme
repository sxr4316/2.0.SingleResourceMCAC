       ==============================================================


The UGST G727 module, version 1.01 (04.Aug.97) consists of the 
following files:

General:
~~~~~~~~
g727.rme: ...... Read-me file for the G.727 module (this file)
g727-tv.rme: ... Description for reset test vectors
porttest.rme: .. Readme file (in g727-tst.zip) with brief description of
                 portability test files.

C program code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
g727.c ......... user entry-level function definition
g727.h ......... prototypes for the user

Demo:
~~~~~
g727demo.c ..... demo program for the encoder and decoder
ugstdemo.h ..... prototypes and definitions needed by UGST demo programs. 
                 Available in other directory. 
discard.c ...... Program to discard LSB bits in ADPCM samples. The
                 program simulates the reduction of packets in the
                 overloading condition in the network. NOTE: This
                 program is in its original form and its I/O has not
                 yet been adapted to the UGST format.

The g727demo program can be used for testing the implementation as
well as for processing speech files. 

NOTE: The original ASCII digital test sequences of ITU-T G.727 have to
      be converted in pure and raw binary format for processing (see
      g727-tv.rme). The test vectors have not been included in the
      UGST distribution.

Makefiles
~~~~~~~~~
Makefiles have been provided for automatic build-up of the executable program
and to process the test sequences, WHEN made available by the user and left
in the subdirectory "tstvector":
makefile.tcc: ... make file for MSDOS Borland tcc
makefile.djc: ... make file for MSDOS port of gcc
makefile.unx: ... make file for Unix, using either cc, acc (Sun), or gcc

The provided makefiles can run a portability test on the demo
program. They need the archive g727-tst.zip ([pk]zip compatible
archive) and [pk]unzip to extract the proper source and reference
processed files. The archive g727-tst.zip contains data in big endian
format and need to be byte-swapped in little-endian systems (e.g. PC &
Digital platforms). Conversion is automatically (hopefully) performed
by the makefile test code.


Compliance Testing:
