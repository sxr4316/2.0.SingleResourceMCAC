    parallelize_right_justified .... parallelization for right-justified data

    There are two families of serialize...() and parallelize_...()
    functions. Ones dates from the STL92 release, and the other was
    generated for the STL96 release. The difference between them is
    that in the STL96, frame boundaries, when marked, follow the
    description in Annex B of ITU-T Rec. G.192, while for the STL92,
    frame boundaries were be marked with a sync word only. In Annex B
    of G.192, frame boundaries are marked by a sync word followed by a
    two-complent 16-bit word with the number of softbits in the
    frame. By default, the G.192-compliant functions are used in the
    STL96. The STL92 version will be used if the symbol STL92 is
    defined during compilation.
 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    NB: all marked with (*) are implemented as macros (#defines), rather
        than true functions! For their definition, please see ugst-utl.h

  18.May.92 v1.2 Correction of `sh2fl' normalization factor calculation;
                 `fl2sh' modified to use floats in the normalizaed range;
                 removed built-in initialization of the `serialize_*'.
                 <tdsimao@cpqd.ansp.br>
  27.Nov.92 v1.3 "fl2sh()" for negative values corrected <hf@pkinbg.uucp>
                 "sh2fl()" fixed for resolution!=16 <bloecher@pkinbg.uucp>
		 created sh2fl_alt()" as an alternate to sh2fl() of the
		 STL92 manual <bloecher@pkinbg.uucp>
  06.Jun.95 v2.0 Fixed erroneous definition of softbits '1' and '0' in the
                 serial<->parallel conversion routines, to make
                 them inline with the EID module, the hardware 8kbit/s codec 
                 host lab EID and G.192. New definitions are '0'=0x7F and 
                 '1'=0x81. <simao@ctd.comsat.com>
  06.Mar.96 v3.0 Created new parallelize_...() and serialize_...() functions 
                 which comply to the bitstream definition given in Annex B 
                 of G.192. <simao@ctd.comsat.com>

        long scale (float *buffer,long smpno,double factor)
        ~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Gain/loss insertion algorithm that scales the input buffer data
        by a given factor. If the factor is greater than 1.0, it means a
        gain; if less than 1.0, a loss. The basic algorithm is simply:
                              y(k)= x(k) * factor
 
        Please note that:
        > the scaled data is put into the same location of the
          original data, in order to save memory space;
        > input data buffer is an array of floats;
        > scaling precision is single (rather than double).
 
        Variables:
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        Name:        I/0: Type:   Use:
        buffer       I/O  float*  Data vector to be scaled.
        smpno         I   long    Number of samples in "buffer"
        factor        I   float   scaling factor
 
        Internal variables are declared as "register" to improve
        processing velocity.
 
        Return value:

        long fl2sh (long  n, float *x, short *iy,
        ~~~~~~~~~~  double half_lsb, unsigned mask);
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Common quantisation routine. The conversion routine expect the
        floating point data to be in the range between -1 .. +1,
        values outside this range are limited to -1 or +32767.0.
        Quantization is done by taking into account only the
        most significant bits. So the quantized (or converted) data are
        located left justified within the 16-bit word, and the results
        are in the range:
                  -32768,( 1),+32767, if quantized to 16 bit
                  -32768,( 2),+32766, if quantized to 15 bit
                  -32768,( 4),+32763, if quantized to 14 bit
                  -32768,( 8),+32760, if quantized to 13 bit
                  -32768,(16),+32752, if quantized to 12 bit
 
        In some cases one needs truncated data. For example, at the
        input of A-Law encoding, truncation to 12 bit is neccessary, not
        rounding. On the other hand within recursive filters rounding is
        essential. So, for both cases functions have been designed.
 
        Concerning the location of the fixed-point data within one 16
        bit word, it's most practical to have the decimal point
        immediateley after the sign bit (between bit 15 and 14, if the
        bits are ordered from 0 ... 15). Since this is well defined, a
        software, which processes the quantized data  needs no knowledge
        about the resolution of the data. It's not important,  whether
        tha data come out from A- or u-Law decoding routines or from
        12-bit (13,14,16-bit) A/D converters.
 
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        n .......... is the number of samples in x[];
        x .......... is input float array's pointer;
        iy ......... is output short array's pointer;
        half_lsb ... is the float representation of 0.5 lsb for the
                     desired resolution (quantization);
        mask ....... unsigned masking of the lower (right) bits.
 
        Returns value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Returns the number of overflows that happened.

                      for the input data in the floating point
                      representation.
        norm ........ flag for normalization:
                      1 ... normalize float data to the range -1..+1;
                      0 ... only convert from short to float,

  long serialize_right_justifiedstl92 (short *par_buf,
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  short *bit_stm, long n, long resol,
                                        char sync);
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a frame of `n' right-justified samples with a
        resolution `resol' into a bitstream of length n*resol. The bit-
        stream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose least significant
        bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending if the
        correspondent bit in the input word was 1 or 0. (Therefore,
        the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!)
 
        If a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word is to be included at frame
        boundaries, then the length of the bit stream is increased to
        (n+1)*resol.
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        NOTE! Be sure that the memory reserved (allocated) for "bit_stm"
              is big enough to accomodate all the data:
               - with sync word: ...... (n+1)*resol
               - without sync word: ...  n*resol
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Please note that the less significant bits of the input word are
        serialized first, such that the bitstream is a stream with less
        significant bits coming first! (Please see example below).
 
        Example: ADPCM input paralell sequence, in blocks of 256
                 samples, for 10 blocks (note that for each frame an
                 individual call to this function is needed!):
 
        Input contents:
 
        frame no.:  |   1st          | | 2nd ...| ... | last one  |
        sample no.:    1    2 ...  256  257 ...         (last one)
        sample:     1011,0101,...,1001 1111 ...          1010
 
        Output:
 
        Word no.:
          1   2 3 4 5 6  ...  *       1026  ...     ...        x
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        |Sync|1|1|0|1|1| ... |1|0|0|1|Sync|1|1|1|1| ... |0|1|0|1|
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        * = word no.1022
        x = word no.10250
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by EID_ONE, `0' as
        EID_ZERO, and the sync word  by SYNC_WORD:
 
                      Bit '0' is represented as '0x007F'
                      Bit '1' is represented as '0x0081'
                      SYNC-word is represented as '0x6B21'
 
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        par_buf ... input buffer with right-adjusted samples to be serialized.
        bit_stm ... output buffer with bitstream.
        n ......... number of words in the input buffer.
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the right-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether a sync word is (1) to be used
                    (appended) in the boundaries of each frame of the
                    bitstream, or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        On success, returns the number of bits of the output bitstream
        (including sync word). If the value returned is 0, the number of
        converted samples is zero.

        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a bitstream of length `bs_len' into a frame
        of bs_len/resol(*) right-justified samples with a resolution
        `resol'. The bitstream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose
        least significant bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending
        if the correspondent bit in the originating word was 1 or 0
        (Therefore, the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!).
        Note that the bits that come first are less significant than the
        next ones, when referring to a same word. Then, when mounting a
        word from the bitstream, bits from the bitstream that comes
        first are allocated to lower significant bits (see example
        below).
 
              (*)PS: if there are sync words in the bitstream, the
                     number of samples per frame is (bs_len-1)/resol.
 
        If a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word is included at frame
        boundaries (parameter sync==1), then sync word is removed from
        the bitstream and not copied to the output buffer.
 
        Example: ADPCM input paralell sequence, in blocks of 256
                 samples, for 10 blocks (note that for each frame an
                 individual call to this function is needed!):
 
        Input contents:
 
        Word no.:

        x = word no.10250
 
        Output:

        sample no.:    1    2 ...  256  257 ...         (last one)
        sample:     1011,0101,...,1001 1111 ...          1010
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by EID_ONE, `0' as
        EID_ZERO, and the sync word  by SYNC_WORD:
 
                      Bit '0' is represented as '0x007F'
                      Bit '1' is represented as '0x0081'
                      SYNC-word is represented as '0x6B21'
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
          NOTE! This routine assumes that memory HAS already been
                allocated to BOTH the bit stream bit_stm and to the
                parallel samples' buffer par_buf.
          ALSO! This routine considers that the first `bit' of the bit-
                stream corresponds to the least significant bit of the
                original word!
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        bit_stm ... input buffer with bitstream to be parallelized.
        par_buf ... output buffer with right-adjusted samples.
        bs_len .... number of bits per frame (ie, size of input buffer).
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the right-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether a sync word is (1) to be used
                    (appended) in the boundaries of each frame of the
                    bitstream, or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        On success, returns the number of parallel words converted from the
        input bitstream (The sync word is removed and not copied to the
        output buffer).

        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a frame of `n' left-justified samples with a
        resolution `resol' into a bitstream of length n*resol. Input
        data is converted first from left-adjusted to right-adjusted
        (both in 2's complement), according to the resolution specified,
        and then converted into a bitstream vector. The bitstream is a
        sequence of 16-bit words whose least significant bits are either
        EID_ONE or EID_ZERO (defined below), depending if the
        correspondent bit in the input word was 1 or 0. (Therefore,
        the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!)
 
        If a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word is to be included at frame
        boundaries, then the length of the bit stream is increased to
        (n+1)*resol.
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        NOTE! Be sure that the memory reserved (allocated) for "bit_stm"
              is big enough to accomodate all the data:
               - with sync word: ...... (n+1)*resol
               - without sync word: ...  n*resol
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Please note that the MOST SIGNIFICANT BITS of the left-
        justified input word are SERIALIZED FIRST, such that the
        bitstream is a stream with most significant bits coming first,
        complementary to the right-justified routines above
	(see example there).
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by EID_ONE, `0' as
        EID_ZERO, and the sync word  by SYNC_WORD:
 
                      Bit '0' is represented as '0x007F'
                      Bit '1' is represented as '0x0081'
                      SYNC-word is represented as '0x6B21'
  
         Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        par_buf ... input buffer with left-adjusted samples to be serialized.
        bit_stm ... output buffer with bitstream.
        n ......... number of words in the input buffer.
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the left-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether a sync word is (1) to be used
                    (appended) in the boundaries of each frame of the
                    bitstream, or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        On success, returns the number of bits of the output bitstream
        (including sync word).

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a bitstream of length `bs_len' into a frame
        of bs_len/resol(*) left-justified samples with a resolution
        `resol'. The bitstream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose
        least significant bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending
        if the correspondent bit in the originating word was 1 or 0.
        (Therefore, the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!)
        Note that the bits that come first are less significant than the
        next ones, when referring to a same word. Then, when mounting a
        word from the bitstream, bits from the bitstream that comes
        first are allocated to lower significant bits, as for the
        right-justified routines above (see example there). Output data
        is converted from right-adjusted to left-adjusted (both in 2's
        complement) before returning, according to the resolution
        specified.
 
              (*)PS: if there are sync words in the bitstream, the
                     number of samples per frame is (bs_len-1)/resol.
 
        If a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word is included at frame
        boundaries (parameter sync==1), then sync word is removed from
        the bitstream and not copied to the output buffer.
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by EID_ONE, `0' as
        EID_ZERO, and the sync word  by SYNC_WORD:
 
                      Bit '0' is represented as '0x007F'
                      Bit '1' is represented as '0x0081'
                      SYNC-word is represented as '0x6B21'
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
          NOTE! This routine assumes that memory HAS already been
                allocated to BOTH the bit stream bit_stm and to the
                parallel samples' buffer par_buf.
          ALSO! This routine considers that the first `bit' of the bit-
                stream corresponds to the least significant bit of the
                original word!
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        bit_stm ... input buffer with bitstream to be parallelized.
        par_buf ... output buffer with left-adjusted samples.
        bs_len .... number of bits per frame (ie, size of input buffer).
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the left-adjusted samples

        long serialize_right_justifiedstl96 (short *par_buf,
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  short *bit_stm, long n, long resol,
                                        char sync);
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a frame of `n' right-justified samples with a
        resolution `resol' into a bitstream of length n*resol. The bit-
        stream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose least significant
        bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending if the
        correspondent bit in the input word was 1 or 0. (Therefore,
        the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!)
 
        If the G.192 Annex B bitstream format is to be used, a
        synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word will be included at frame
        boundaries, followed by a 16-bit word indicating the frame
        length, i.e., the number of softbits in the frame. In this
        case, the the length of the bit stream is increased to
        (n+2)*resol. The option of adding only the sync word, as
        implemented in the STL92, is no longer available with this
        function.
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        NOTE! Be sure that the memory reserved (allocated) for "bit_stm"
              is big enough to accomodate all the data:
               - with sync word + frame length: ...... (n+2)*resol shorts
               - without sync word: ..................  n*resol shorts
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Please note that the LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITS of the
        right-justified input words are serialized FIRST, such that
        the bitstream is a stream with less significant bits coming
        first! (Please see example below).
 
        Example: ADPCM input paralell sequence, in blocks of 256
                 samples, for 10 blocks (note that for each frame an
                 individual call to this function is needed!):
 
        Input contents:
 
        frame no.:  |   1st          | | 2nd ...| ... | last one  |
        sample no.:    1    2 ...  256  257 ...         (last one)
        sample:     1011,0101,...,1001 1111 ...          1010
 
        Output:
 
        Word no. (in output bitstream array):
          1   2 3 4 5 6 7  ...  *       1027  ...       ...        x
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        |Sync|#|1|1|0|1|1| ... |1|0|0|1|Sync|#|1|1|1|1| ... |0|1|0|1|
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        # = 1024 (i.e., 256 samples/frame * 4 bits/sample = 1024 bits/frame)
        * = word no.1022
        x = word no.10260
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by the softbit
        EID_ONE, `0' as the softbit EID_ZERO, and the sync word by
        SYNC_WORD:
	    Hardbit '0' is represented as the softbit '0x007F'
	    Hardbit '1' is represented as the softbit '0x0081'
	    SYNC-word is represented as the word '0x6B21'
	    # is represented in two-complement notation
 
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        par_buf ... input buffer with right-adjusted samples to be serialized.
        bit_stm ... output buffer with bitstream.
        n ......... number of words in the input buffer, i.e., the number of
	            parallel samples/frame.
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the right-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether the G.192 Annex B bitstream 
                    format (1) is to be used (i.e., a sync word and a 
                    bitstream length word are added at frame boundaries), 
                    or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        On success, returns the total number of softbits in the output
        bitstream, including the including sync word and frame length.
        If the value returned is 0, the number of converted samples is
        zero.

        long parallelize_right_justifiedstl96 (short *bit_stm, short *par_buf,
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  long bs_len, long resol, char sync);
 
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a bitstream of length `bs_len' into a frame
        of bs_len/resol(*) right-justified samples with a resolution
        `resol'. The bitstream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose
        least significant bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending
        if the correspondent bit in the originating word was 1 or 0
        (Therefore, the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!).
        Note that the bits that come first are less significant than the
        next ones, when referring to the same word. Then, when mounting a
        word from the bitstream, bits from the bitstream that comes
        first are converted to lower significant bits (see example
        below).
 
              (*)PS: if the bitstream is compatible with G.192 Annex B, 
                     the number of parallel samples per frame  
                     is (bs_len-2)/resol.
 
        If the G.192 Annex B bitstream format is used (parameter
        sync==1), a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word followed by a 16-bit
        word (indicating the number of softbits per frame) are
        present at frame boundaries in the input buffer. In this
        case, the sync and frame lengthwords are removed from the
        bitstream and not copied to the output buffer.

        Note that all parallel samples are supposed to have a constant
        number of bits for the whole frame. This means that, by
        construction, the number of softbits divided by the resolution
        must be an integer number, or (bs_len-2)%resol==0. If this
        does not happen, probably the serial bitstream was not
        generated by one of the serialize_...() routines, and cannot
        be parallelized by this function. As an example, this is the
        case of the RPE-LTP bitstream: the 260 bits of the encoded
        bitstream are not divided equally among the 76 parameters of
        the bitstream. In cases like this, the user must write its own
        parallelization function when the number of bits is not
        constant for all parallel samples in the frame.
 
        Example: ADPCM input paralell sequence, in blocks of 256
                 samples, for 10 blocks (note that for each frame an
                 individual call to this function is needed!):
 
        Input contents:
 
        Word no. (in input bitstream array):
          1   2 3 4 5 6 7  ...  *       1027  ...       ...        x
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        |Sync|#|1|1|0|1|1| ... |1|0|0|1|Sync|#|1|1|1|1| ... |0|1|0|1|
        +----+-+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+----+-+-+-+-+-+ ... +-+-+-+-+
        # = 1024 (i.e., 256 samples/frame * 4 bits/sample = 1024 bits/frame)
        * = word no.1022
        x = word no.10260
 
        Output:
 
        frame no.:  |   1st          | | 2nd ...| ... | last one  |
        sample no.:    1    2 ...  256  257 ...         (last one)
        sample:     1011,0101,...,1001 1111 ...          1010
 
        Here, the bitstream value `1' is defined by the softbit
        EID_ONE, `0' as the softbit EID_ZERO, and the sync word by
        SYNC_WORD:
	    Hardbit '0' is represented as the softbit '0x007F'
	    Hardbit '1' is represented as the softbit '0x0081'
	    SYNC-word is represented as the word '0x6B21'
	    # is represented in two-complement notation

 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
          NOTE! This routine assumes that memory HAS already been
                allocated to BOTH the bit stream bit_stm and to the
                parallel samples' buffer par_buf.
          ALSO! This routine considers that the first `bit' of the bit-
                stream corresponds to the least significant bit of the
                original word!
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        bit_stm ... input buffer with bitstream to be parallelized.
        par_buf ... output buffer with right-adjusted samples.
        bs_len .... number of bits per frame (ie, size of input buffer, 
                    which includes sync/length words if sync==1).
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the right-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether the G.192 Annex B bitstream 
                    format (1) is to be used (i.e., a sync word and a 
                    bitstream length word are added at frame boundaries), 
                    or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

        On success, returns the number of parallel words extracted
        from the input bitstream (the sync and legth words are removed
        and not copied to the output buffer). If the number of sofbits
        (plus sync and legth words) expected by the user (as specified
        in parameter bs_len) does not match with the bitstream length
        word (bit_stm[1]), a negative number (-bs_len[1]) is returned,
        and all samples in the output frame are set to 0. If the number
        of softbits in the frame is not an integer multiple of the
        number parallel samples, then -1 is returned (all samples in
        par_buf are also set to -1).  If a bad-frame indicator
        (0x6B20) is present, no valid samples are returned and the
        output buffer will contain just zero samples.

        length, i.e., the number of softbits in the frame. In this
        case, the the length of the bit stream is increased to
        (n+2)*resol. The option of adding only the sync word, as
        implemented in the STL92, is no longer available with this
        function.
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        NOTE! Be sure that the memory reserved (allocated) for "bit_stm"
              is big enough to accomodate all the data:
               - with sync word + frame length: ...... (n+2)*resol
               - without sync word: ..................  n*resol
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Please note that the LEAST SIGNIFICANT BITS of the
        right-justified input words are serialized FIRST, such that
        the bitstream is a stream with less significant bits coming
        first! (Please see example in serialize_right_justified() above).

        The bitstream value `1' is defined by the softbit
        EID_ONE, `0' as the softbit EID_ZERO, and the sync word by
        SYNC_WORD:
	    Hardbit '0' is represented as the softbit '0x007F'
	    Hardbit '1' is represented as the softbit '0x0081'
	    SYNC-word is represented as the word '0x6B21'
	    # is represented in two-complement notation
  
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        par_buf ... input buffer with left-adjusted samples to be serialized.
        bit_stm ... output buffer with bitstream.
        n ......... number of words in the input buffer, i.e., the number of
	            parallel samples/frame.
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the left-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether the G.192 Annex B bitstream 
                    format (1) is to be used (i.e., a sync word and a 
                    bitstream length word are added at frame boundaries), 
                    or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        On success, returns the number of bits of the output bitstream
        (including sync word).

        long parallelize_left_justifiedstl96 (short *bit_stm, short *par_buf,
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ long bs_len, long resol, char sync);
 
 
        Description:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
        Routine to convert a bitstream of length `bs_len' into a frame
        of bs_len/resol(*) left-justified samples with a resolution
        `resol'. The bitstream is a sequence of 16-bit words whose
        least significant bits are either EID_ONE or EID_ZERO, depending
        if the correspondent bit in the originating word was 1 or 0.
        (Therefore, the bitstream 16-bit words are always right-justified!)
        Note that the bits that come first are less significant than the
        next ones, when referring to a same word. Then, when mounting a
        word from the bitstream, bits from the bitstream that comes
        first are allocated to lower significant bits, as for the
        right-justified routines above (see example there). Output data
        is converted from right-adjusted to left-adjusted (both in 2's
        complement) before returning, according to the resolution
        specified.
 
              (*)PS: if there are sync words in the bitstream, the
                     number of samples per frame is (bs_len-2)/resol.
 
        If the G.192 Annex B bitstream format is used (parameter
        sync==1), a synchronism (SYNC_WORD) word followed by a 16-bit
        word (indicating the number of softbits per frame) are
        present at frame boundaries in the input buffer. In this
        case, the sync and frame lengthwords are removed from the
        bitstream and not copied to the output buffer.

        Note that all parallel samples are supposed to have a constant
        number of bits for the whole frame. This means that, by
        construction, the number of softbits divided by the resolution
        must be an integer number, or (bs_len-2)%resol==0. If this
        does not happen, probably the serial bitstream was not
        generated by one of the serialize_...() routines, and cannot
        be parallelized by this function. As an example, this is the
        case of the RPE-LTP bitstream: the 260 bits of the encoded
        bitstream are not divided equally among the 76 parameters of
        the bitstream. In cases like this, the user must write its own
        parallelization function when the number of bits is not
        constant for all parallel samples in the frame.

        The bitstream value `1' is defined by the softbit
        EID_ONE, `0' as the softbit EID_ZERO, and the sync word by
        SYNC_WORD:
	    Hardbit '0' is represented as the softbit '0x007F'
	    Hardbit '1' is represented as the softbit '0x0081'
	    SYNC-word is represented as the word '0x6B21'
	    # is represented in two-complement notation
 
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
          NOTE! This routine assumes that memory HAS already been
                allocated to BOTH the bit stream bit_stm and to the
                parallel samples' buffer par_buf.
          ALSO! This routine considers that the first `bit' of the bit-
                stream corresponds to the least significant bit of the
                original word!
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
        Parameters:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        bit_stm ... input buffer with bitstream to be parallelized.
        par_buf ... output buffer with left-adjusted samples.
        bs_len .... number of bits per frame (ie, size of input buffer, 
                    which includes sync/length words if sync==1).
        resol ..... resolution (number of bits) of the left-adjusted samples
                    in par_buf.
        sync ...... flag to say whether the G.192 Annex B bitstream 
                    format (1) is to be used (i.e., a sync word and a 
                    bitstream length word are added at frame boundaries), 
                    or (0) not.
 
        Return value:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        On success, returns the number of parallel words extracted
        from the input bitstream (the sync and legth words are removed
        and not copied to the output buffer). If the number of sofbits
        (plus sync and legth words) expected by the user (as specified
        in parameter bs_len) does not match with the bitstream length
        word (bit_stm[1]), a negative number (-bs_len[1]) is returned,
        and all samples in the output frame are set to 0. If the number
        of softbits in the frame is not an integer multiple of the
        number parallel samples, then -1 is returned (all samples in
        par_buf are also set to -1).  If a bad-frame indicator
        (0x6B20) is present, no valid samples are returned and the
        output buffer will contain just zero samples.
