Notes:
~~~~~~
- firdemo (formerly hqdemo) does not implement the psophometric filter, but 
  can cascade several filtering options, while filter does implement it,
  but can run only one filtering at a time. Besides truncation problems,
  filter may implement the operations performed by firdemo by cascading
  several runs of filter.

- files test001.ref to test011.ref and test018.ref to test023.ref are used
  to test both filter and firdemo. Files test012.ref to test017.ref are used
  to test only firdemo, and files testpcm[1du].ref, test-pso.ref, test-asy.ref,
  test-cas.ref, and test-sac.ref are only used to test filter.c.

- automatic test procedure are available in the makefiles:
	make-vms.com - for VAX/VMS Vax-cc compiler or the VMS port of gcc
	makefile.bcc - for MSDOS Borland bcc
	makefile.djc - for MSDOS port of gcc
	makefile.unx - for Unix, using either cc, acc (Sun), or gcc

- all the binary files are in the Sun format (High-byte first), and to be
  used in VMS and MSDOS need to have every even and odd bytes swapped.

- the .ref files have been generated from test.src for the reference
  implementation of the programs compiled by Sun's cc compiler, with the 
  exception of:
  + test-pso.ref, whose reference implementation was compiled with 
    Sun's ANSI C compiler acc;
  + test024.ref, testp341.ref, test-asy.ref, test-cas.ref, test-sac,
    rxmirs16.ref, and rxmirs8.ref were generated by gcc on a HP
    workstation running HP-UX.
  You may expect that running the program in other platforms may generate 
  files that are not identical, but that may have some different samples, 
  due to rounding errors. Therefore, expect errors in the range of +-1 
  when comparing the reference files and your processed ones.

 - test019.ref was updated according to the modifications done on fir-irs.c for the modified IRS send-part filter (48 kHz). ** 3 december 2004
