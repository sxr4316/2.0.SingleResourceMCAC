==============================================================================
History: 
The ITU-T G.722 software tool was first released in STL96. 
During ITU-T 2005-2008 Study period, the G.722 module was updated to make it 
compliant with G.192 bitstream format and enable EID-XOR/G.192 style of frame
and bit error application to G.722. Basic reference Packet Loss Concealment 
functionality was included. STL2005 v2.2 basic operators and complexity counters 
were introduced.   


14.Mar.95  v1.0       Released for use ITU-T UGST software package Tool

                      based on the CNET's 07/01/90 version 2.00

01.Jul.95  v2.0       Changed function declarations to work with many compilers;

                      reformated <simao@ctd.comsat.com>

22.May.06  v2.3       Updated with g192 format reading and basic index domain PLC functionality;

                      <{nicklas.sandgren,jonas.svedberg}@ericsson.com>

10.Jan.07  v3.0       Updated with STL2005 v2.2 basic operators and G.729.1 methodology
;

================================================================================



The ITU-T/UGST G.722 module with G192/PLC, version 3.0 (10/Jan/2007) 
contains the following files:


General:
~~~~~~~~
 g722.rme: ..... Read-me file for g722 module (this file)


C program code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
funcg722.c ..... functions for the G.722 codec
g722.c ......... user entry-level function definition
g722.h ......... prototypes for the user
operg722.c ..... operators for the G.722 codec
funcg722.h ..... protypes and definitions for the functions of the G.722 codec
g722.h ......... prototypes for the user
operg722.h ..... protypes and definitions for the operators for the G.722 codec
g722_com.h ..... definitions for the G.192 interface and the basic PLC options
softbit.h ...... prototypes for G.192 file interfaces. Available in other directory.
softbit.c ...... functions for the G.192 file interfaces. Available in other directory.

Demo:
~~~~~
encg722.c ...... demo program for the encoder
decg722.c ...... demo program for the decoder
g722demo.c ..... demo program for the encoder and decoder

Test programs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two main programs are provided for testing the implementation using the ITU-T
test sequences: 
tstcg722.c ..... program to pass the test sequences by the G.722
                 encoder. QMF filter is not included. For implementation
		 verification test purposes *only*. Needs test vectors, not
		 included in the UGST distribution.
tstdg722.c ..... program to pass the test sequences by the G.722
                 decoder. QMF filter is not included. For implementation
		 verification test purposes *only*. Needs test vectors, not
		 included in the UGST distribution.

These two programs are for testing the implementations only and are not
intended for processing speech files. 

The original ASCII digital test sequences of ITU-T G.722 have to be converted
in pure and raw binary format for processing. The test vectors have not been
included in the UGST distribution. QMF filter is not included in these two 
programs. 

Makefiles
~~~~~~~~~
Makefiles have been provided for automatic build-up of the executable program
and to process the test sequences, WHEN made available by the user and left
in the subdirectory "bin":
makefile.cl: .... make file for MS Visual C compiler
makefile.unx: ... make file for Unix, using either cc, acc (Sun), or gcc, or for Cygwin/gcc

The provided makefiles can run a portability test on the demo program. They 
need the archive tst-g722.zip ([pk]zip compatible archive) and [pk]unzip to 
extract the proper source and reference processed files. 

tst-g722.zip: ... ZIP-compatible archive with the test files in the Unix
                  byte orientation (high-byte first). Running
                  (pk)unzip -v produces an equivalent to the following:
 Length  Method   Size  Ratio   Date    Time   CRC-32     Name
