Running "make test" will build the programs and run
the u-law and a-law conformance tests.

The codebase has limited instrumentation for debug
at this time, however running "make debug" will build
the programs and run the u-law and a-law conformance
tests with debugging turned on.

Useful scripts:

chk ........ runs g.726 encoder and decoder ansi vector test suites
              configuration as specified in the vector README files

chk_g711 ... runs g.711 encoder and decoder test cases
              uses either an g.711 encoder chain
                  encoder -> decoder -> encoder
              or g.711 decoder chain
                  decoder -> encoder -> decoder
              to test g.711 (currently perl or AWK or visual inspection)

----

r3.0  - additional mod's to processing of u-law
         - added necessary spec requirements to process a-law pcm
          current does not fully work
        - created tst_g711 to qualify u-law & a-law g.711 operation

r2.0  - mod's to process only ascii
         binary files can be processed with the following
         utilities; binary files can be produced with a
         sun audiofile header
        - created pcma2b (convert an ascii pcm file to binary)
        - created pcmb2a (convert an binary pcm file to ascii)
        - created stripInit to strip the initializion block
          from an ascii or binary pcm file

r1.0  - original work, process only binary pcm files
         (w/o sun audiofile header)
        - created enc to encode u-law pcm to adpcm
        - created dec to decode adpcm to u-law pcm
