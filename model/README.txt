Behavioral model work directories:

adpcm-itu ... 'C' model of ADPCM based on ITU standard
                  eventually will support:
                  40 kbps G.726
                  32 kbps G.726
                  24 kbps G.726
                  16 kbps G.726
                  u-law PCM
                  a-law PCM
                  Note: initially seeded from "adpcm" directory

adpcm ....... 'C' model of ADPCM based on ANSI standard
                  similar to 32 kbps G.726
                  ansi u-law vectors pass
                  Note: DO NOT EDIT THIS SOURCE CODE

adpcm-c++ ... reference implemetations in C++
                  found on web - don't know if this software works

G.191 ....... ITU-T Software tools for speech and audio coding
                  standardization; includes G.711 & G.726
                  Released Geneva, November 2009
