========================
Usage
========================
The C code consists of the G.711-LLC codec implementation (source/g711llc folder), several auxiliary sources, and the source code of a command line application (source/g711llc.c) that can simulate both the encoder and decoder.

The command line for encoding is as follows:
g711llc [-v] [-e|-enc] [-u|-a] [-n#] <infile> [<outfile>]

where:
<infile>	Name of the input file to be encoded. Extension can be ul8, mu8, mu for mu-law, al8, al for A-law, or any other extension (in which case the law type has to be manually specified).
[<outfile>]	Name of the output bitstream file. The preferred extensions are: lcm for mu-law, and lca for A-law. If the output filename is not specified, it will be automatically generated by replacing the extension of the input file with the preferred extension.
[-v]	Verbose mode. If specified, the encoder will print extended information to the standard output after encoding each frame.
[-e|-enc]	Force encoding mode. Normally there is no need to specify this flag because the mode can be deduced from the input filename.
[-u|-a]	Force the law type. Normally there is no need to specify either of these flags because the law type can be deduced from the input filename.
[-n#]	Frame length. # can be one of 40, 80, 160, 240, or 320. If not specified, it defaults to 160.

The command line for decoding is as follows:
g711llc [-v] [-u|-a] <infile> [<outfile>]

where:
<infile>	Name of the input bitstream file to be decoded. Extensions can be lcm for mu-law, lca for A-law, or any other extension (in which case the law type has to be manually specified).
[<outfile>]	Name of the decoded output file. The preferred extensions are: muo for mu-law, and alo for A-law. If the output filename is not specified, it will be automatically generated by replacing the extension of the input file with the preferred extension.
[-v]	Verbose mode. If specified, the decoder will print extended information to the standard output after decoding each frame.
[-u|-a]	Force the law type. Normally there is no need to specify either of these flags because the law type can be deduced from the input filename.

In the above descriptions, square brackets mean that the enclosed command line option can be omitted, and vertical lines mean selection between the options they separate.
The encoder input and decoder output files are sampled data files containing [ITU-T G.711] PCM signals. The encoder output and decoder input files consist of concatenated [ITU-T G.711-LLC] frames (as defined in this standard).
